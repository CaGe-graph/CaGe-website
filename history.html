      <p>2025-07-19</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed some more issues with recent version of gcc.</li>
        <li>The nanojoin generator always output an extra zero after the last graph. This has been removed.</li>
        <li>
          The installation script now first runs <code>make clean</code> before installing the generators and embedders.
          This solves some issues for people who have previously installed CaGe and then update it.

      </ul>
      <p>2010-12-07</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug in embedders for nanocones and nanotubes: output of graphs with more than 1000 vertices contained errors.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The tube generator was found to contain an error that was probably present all the time but
revealed by a change of compiler. From a certain time on the numbers of structures were different than those
published -- and generate by the same program. The generator is now replaced by one not showing
this behaviour.</li>
        <li>Some generators weren't compiled with -O4.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>2010-03-10</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Added a dock icon on Mac OS X and window icons on Linux.</li>
		<li>Added two new embedders written by Simon Buelens: these embedders are specific embedders for nanocones and nanotubes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>2009-06-19</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The categories of CaGe have been reorganized and several generator panels have been reworked.</li>
        <li>Generators were added for quadrangulations, 4-regular plane graphs, nanocones, hydrocarbons for
		    a given boundary structure and hydrocarbons for a given number of hexagons.</li>
        <li>CaGe now uses version 11.4.4 of Jmol instead of version 0.6.4.</li>
        <li>File and pipe are separated options in the output panel.</li>
        <li>Added separate field for input from file in the external generator panel.</li>
        <li>The "embed as" section of the external generator panel has been completely reworked.</li>
      </ul>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2008-07-16</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A bug in
	  embed.c was fixed: for graphs with adjacent pairs of vertices of degree two,
	  an incorrect outer face could appear in planar embeddings.
	  In rare circumstances, this would prevent the user from choosing
	  an outer face by mouse click.
          </font></li>
      </ul>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2008-01-10</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Updated
	  three generator source files (<a href="fullerenes.html">fullgen.c</a>,
	  <a href="tubetypes.html">tubetypes.c</a>, <a href="hydrocarbons.html">HCgen.c</a>)
	  to obtain a constant for timekeeping (CLK_TCK) in a more compatible way.
	  This should resolve compilation problems on recent Ubuntu systems. We have
	  also observed problems with opening CaGe Windows on current Ubuntu systems
	  using the Compiz window manager (Compiz&nbsp;0.6.1), but this seems to be
	  a known problem between Compiz and Java. We can therefore only recommend
	  switching to a different window manager.

          stop an interactive task by releasing the &quot;flow&quot; button, CaGe
          used to continue reading the generator's input until the next graph
          had come in completely. The user had to wait for this indefinite amount
          of time before it was possible to choose where to advance next (although
          reviewing was always possible while waiting for a new graph). Now, when
          stopping, CaGe has access to the latest graph that has finished being
          read, so the stop is immediate and CaGe completes reading the next graph
          in the background. If the graph stopped at in this way is new to CaGe,
          it will be displayed in the usual way; if not, no further action is
          taken. Another consequence of this change: if you start flowing or advancing
          and no new graph is coming in soon, you can stop and use the buttons
          to advance to a different graph than the one you targeted before. Say
          you pressed &quot;+10&quot; and the graph number doesn't increase for
          a while. You can then release &quot;flow&quot; and press &quot;+1&quot;
          to advance to that earlier graph instead. It works the other way round
          as well (advance by 1 first, then change your mind and advance by 10
          before the first graph has arrived), and you can change between flowing
          and advancing as well.<br>

          <font size="1">&gt; <br>
          &gt; I have a suggestion concerning the PS files written by TwoView.<br>
          &gt; Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the picture manually for<br>
          &gt; publication, especially for larger graphs. To make this easier,<br>
          &gt; the coordinates of each vertex can be written just once.<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; For example, instead of<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; 1.1111 2.2222 3.3333 4.4444 edge<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; 1.1111 2.2222 vertex<br>
          &gt; 3.3333 4.4444 vertex<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; use<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; /v1 { 1.1111 2.2222 } bind def<br>
          &gt; /v2 { 3.3333 4.4444 } bind def<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; v1 v2 edge<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; v1 vertex<br>
          &gt; v2 vertex<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; Now each vertex is easy to move. Of course, when vertex numbers<br>
          &gt; are drawn the name of the vertex (eg &quot;v2&quot;) should correspond
          to the<br>
          &gt; number (eg &quot;2&quot;).<br>
          &gt; <br>
          &gt; ALSO, it would be nice if there was a way to configure the colour<br>
          &gt; of the vertex number and the colour used to fill the vertex.<br>
          &gt; <br>
          </font>There are TwoView parameters in </font><tt><b>CaGe.ini</b></tt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
          to set the three colours used (one for the numbers, two for the blend
          fill inside the vertex symbols). These are explained in </font><tt><b>CaGe.ini</b></tt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.
          TwoView copies them to the front of every single graph it writes to
          a PS file, so colours can be changed for a single graph by editing the
          respective setting in the PS file. To change the default colours, edit
          </font><tt><b>CaGe.ini</b></tt><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.
          Note that these options apply only to the PS files written by TwoView,
          not the screen display. The default settings produce PostScript colors
          matching those in the TwoView window.</font>

          in the output window): 1. go back to the generator window (click "Previous"),
          change some option that affects the embedder command line and return
          to output options ("Next"); or 2. (as it will generally be unclear in
          1. how a change to the embedder command lines can be caused:) clear
          the embedder command line that is to be reset, go back to the generator
          window and then forward to the output window again (clicking "Previous"
          and then "Next" immediately). <BR>
          <BR>
          Setting expert mode also adds a "Previous" button to the results window,
          so output options of the current generator process are now just one
          mouse click away from the results window. By clicking "Previous" in
          the results window, the generation process is stopped (as in "Cancel"
          which returns to the very first window of CaGe) and the output window
          redisplayed in the state is was left. No embedder or generator command
          lines are reset to the state that would be suggested by the generator
          window. (The "Previous" button is not provided in "non-expert" mode
          for aesthetic reasons.</font></LI>
