        Molecules and Graphs</h1>
      <p>CaGe is a 
        mathematical software package that is intended to be a service to chemists 
        as well as mathematicians. As the program deals with graphs on the mathematics 
        side and molecules on the chemistry side, let us explain how the two concepts 
        translate into each other. We will begin by introducing some simple terminology.</p>
      <h1>Molecules</h1>
      <p><b><a name="molecule"></a>Molecules</b> 
        are, for the purposes of this program, collections of <b>atoms</b> linked 
        by <b>bonds</b> to form fixed structures (not changing with time). CaGe's 
        generators enumerate sets of molecules -- or to be exact 
        <i> graphs that are models for molecules </i> -- 
	that share certain properties given by the user, e.g. the 
        same constituional formula and probably some additional properties.</p> 


        <p>But all molecules that are generated differ in structure -- they are 
        pairwise non-isomorphic. 
        Reflecting, rotating or scaling a molecule or 
        changing some bond angles or lengths does not count as a structural difference. 
        The &quot;properties&quot; that can be chosen to be shared by a 
	generated set of molecules  
        depend on what type of molecules are to be generated and differ from generator to generator.</p>
      <h1>Graphs (embeddings, dual graphs)</h1>
      <p><b><a name="graph"></a>Graphs</b> 
        are very simple mathematical objects. They consist of <b>vertices</b> 
        (or nodes) and <b>edges</b> (or connections). If two vertices are connected 
        by an edge they are said to be <b>adjacent</b>. Actually, the term &quot;adjacent&quot; 
        can be applied to any pair of graph constituents -- any combination of 
        two vertices, edges, or faces (see below) -- if they are &quot;next to&quot; 
        each other.</p>
      <p><a name="valency"></a>The 
        number of edges starting at a vertex (or the number of adjacent vertices) 
        is the <b>valency</b> or <b>degree</b> of that vertex. A node with valency 
        <i>n</i> is said to be <i><b>n</b></i><b>-valent</b>. <a name="regular"></a>A 
        graph is called <i><b>n</b></i><b>-regular</b> if every vertex is <i>n</i>-valent. 
        Some of our generators specialize in producing regular graphs.</p>
      <p><a name="embedding"></a>At 
        this level, a graph represents the information that chemists sometimes 
        call the <b>connection table</b> of a molecule. For a visual representation, 
        we also need to assign (2D or 3D) coordinates to our vertices, this is 
        known as an <b>embedding</b> of the graph (into 2D or 3D space). The edges 
        are then drawn as arbitrary curves between the vertices (straight line 
        segments are preferred, but not required). A graph with an embedding is 
        sometimes called a <b>map</b>.</p>
      <p><a name="planar"></a>When 
        a graph is to be drawn on paper, it is desirable to draw the edges so 
        that they don't cross each other. If this is possible (the graph has a 
        2D embedding that permits intersection-free edge drawing), the graph is 
        said to be <b>planar</b>. (Note that the term &quot;planar&quot; exists 
        in chemistry as well, but with a different meaning.) The condition of 
        planarity is fulfilled for all the molecule types that we currently generate. 
        Looking at a drawing of a graph with more or less straight edges, you 
        will perceive <b>faces</b> as well as edges and vertices. A face is a 
        2D region bounded by some of the graph's edges. (Don't forget the one 
        face defined by the &quot;outside&quot; of the graph.) Depending on the 
        number of edges bounding it, a face can be a triangle, quadrangle, pentagon, 
        hexagon, and so on. The number of bounding edges is the face's <b>size</b>. 
        (If you must travel along some edge twice when going around a face, that 
        edge counts twice.)</p>

      <p><br>
        <a name="dual"></a>Picture a planar graph with its vertices, edges and 
        faces. You can then obtain a new graph, the <b>dual</b> of the original 
        graph, as follows: First create a new (dual) vertex in the interior of 
        each face of the original graph. For each original edge, find the faces 
        bounded by that edge and connect the dual vertices inside them by a new 
        (dual) edge, crossing the original one. (You may have the same original 
        face on both sides of the edge; this will create a &quot;loop&quot; edge, 
        starting and ending at the same dual vertex. You may also find two faces 
        having more than one edge in common; the dual will then have two edges 
        starting and ending at the same vertices, such a graph is called a &quot;multi-graph&quot;. 
        Our embedders will not handle loop edges or multi-graphs, and CaGe will 
        not allow our generators to produce them, not even as duals.)<br>
        <i>Dualizing exchanges vertex degree and face size:</i> The degree of 
        each dual vertex is clearly equal to the size of the corresponding original 
        face: each edge bounding the original face creates a dual edge starting 
        at the dual vertex. Likewise, a dual face's size is equal to the degree 
        of the corresponding original vertex: observe how the dual graph's faces 
        form around the original vertices, bounded by those dual edges that cross 
        the original edges starting at the original vertex. <i>The number of edges 
        remains unchanged.</i> (This follows directly from the way a dual graph 
        is defined.) <br>
        Constructing the dual of the dual graph gives you back the original graph. 
        (Vertex positions will probably have shifted, but that only changes the 
        embedding, not the graph.)</p>
      <p><a name="k_connected"></a>A 
        graph is called <i><b>k</b></i><b>-(vertex)-connected</b> if one must 
        remove at least <i>k</i> vertices in order to separate the graph into 
        disconnected parts. If <i>k</i> vertices are also &quot;enough&quot; to 
        separate the graph (there is some set of <i>k</i> vertices that, when 
        removed, achieves the separation), we say the graph is <b>exactly <i>k</i>-connected</b>. 
        The number <i>k</i> is then called the <b>connectivity</b> of the graph. 
        (Removing a vertex implies removing all edges adjacent to it.)</p>
      <h1>Translating Molecules into Graphs</h1>
      <p><a name="translating"></a>An 
        atom in chemistry is represented by a vertex in graph theory. A bond between 
        two atoms is represented by an edge. We represent a double or triple bond 
        by a single edge (multi-graphs are not allowed), and there is no extra 
        information attached to edges. Therefore, bond order (whether a bond is 
        single, double, or triple) is not represented in our graphs.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, 
        an atom's chemical valency might not be equal to the &quot;graph valency&quot; 
        (or degree) of the corresponding vertex. For example, the degree of a 
        carbon atom might be less than 4, since double bonds are only counted 
        once. We do however use the degree of a vertex to find the corresponding 
        atom's type (we also need to use our knowledge of the kind of molecule 
        we are generating, which narrows down the choice of atom types to just 
        one or two for most generators).</p>
