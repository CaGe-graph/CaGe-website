<h3 align=center>Getting started</h3>
To create the cage program, you need to have the following files in
one directory:<br>
<center>
-  cage.c<br>
-  spring.c<br>
-  schlegel.c<br>
-  fullgen.c<br>
-  HCgen.c<br>
-  makefile<br>
</center>
<br>
The program is compiled by entering this directory and typing<br>
<br>
<center>  make cage<br></center>
<br>
However, some include files and some libraries are needed which must be 
installed somewhere on your computer. These are the files<br>
<br>
<center>
 tcl.h<br>
 tk.h<br>
 libX11.a<br>
 libtcl.so<br>
 libtk.so<br>
</center>
<br>
If these files are not stored in the default directories for include
files and libraries (normally "/usr/include" and "/usr/lib"), then you
must provide the paths to the directories in which the files can be found.
This is done in the makefile.
In the current version of the makefile, two examples are given:<br>
<br>

# for SGI:<br>
TCLINCLUDE = /vol/local/include<br>
TCLLIB     = /vol/local/lib<br>
X11LIB     = /usr/lib<br>

# for Linux:<br>
#TCLINCLUDE = /vol/X11/include<br>
#TCLLIB     = /vol/X11/lib<br>
#X11LIB     = /usr/lib<br>

<br>
The "#" at the beginning of a line indicates that the line is a comment.
So in this example "/vol/local/include" is the directory in which the files 
"tcl.h" and "tk.h" are searched for and "/vol/local/lib" and "/usr/lib" are
the directories in which the files "libX11.a", "libtcl.a" and "libtk.a" are
searched for. 
Change the path specifications so that they fit to your system. Then type
"make cage".<br>
<br>
Once the program "cage" is created, you can start it by typing<br>
<br>
<center>cage </center><br>
<br>
<h3 align=center> Some problems </align></h3><br>
<br>
<strong>1) Shared libraries:</strong><br>
<br>
Tcl uses shared libraries. Therefore, e.g. under Linux,
the option -ldl is sometimes also required in the makefile.<br> 
<br>
cage : cage.c fullgen HCgen spring schlegel tubetype CPF<br>
	cc -o cage cage.c -I$(TCLINCLUDE) -L$(TCLLIB) -L$(X11LIB) \<br>
           -lm -ltcl -ltk -lX11 -ldl <strong> <-- </strong><br>
<br>
Otherwise you get the
error message:<br> 
<br>
/vol/X11/lib/libtcl.so: undefined reference to `dlerror'<br>
/vol/X11/lib/libtcl.so: undefined reference to `dlopen'<br>
/vol/X11/lib/libtcl.so: undefined reference to `dlsym'<br>
<br>
<strong>2) Tcl and Tk versions:</strong><br>
<br>
Tcl and Tk versions are not very compatible. The actuell
version of CaGe requires Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0. 
To know which version is installed, type:<br>
<br>
  wish<br>
  % put $tcl_version<br>
  8.0<br>
  % put $tk_version<br>
  8.0<br>
<br>
If you are trying to run CaGe under Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2,
CaGe will work fine until you start one of the generating 
programs and it will then cause an error:<br>
<br>
  Segmentation fault.
<br>
<h3 align=center>Some hints for usage </align></h3><br>
<br>
We hope that the usage of cage is self-explaining. However, here are
some hints:<br>
<br>
- The window with the "Quit" button and the "Go to background" button
  always remains on the screen as long as neither of these buttons is
  pressed. By pressing the "Quit" button, you can exit the program.
  By pressing the "Go to background" button, you can do the same, but
  if there is one graph generation process running, it will not be 
  cancelled. It will continue in the background.<br>
<br>
- After choosing a generation program, an option window appears.
  Some of the options are included into a box named "extra options".
  These options are only important for users who know the generation
  program very well. 
  By pressing "Start", the graphs are generated.
  By pressing "Cancel", you return to the window where you can choose
  another generation program.<br>
<br>
- If you choose 3D output, then "cage" pipes this output to other
  programs. Two possibilities are offered:<br>
<br>
<center>
  - RasMol<br>
  - GeomView<br>
</center>
<br>
  You can only use these options if the relative programs are installed to
  your system! Otherwise cage will cause an error. Furthermore, these
  programs must be executable just by typing their names ("rasmol" or
  "geomview", respectively) without any additional path information.
  If you use RasMol, then you must move the mouse inside the RasMol window
  after it appears on the screen. If you use GeomView, then notice that
  GeomView is not quitted automatically if you quit cage. You must
  quit it yourself. Furthermore, a pipe program named "togeomview" must
  be provided.<br>
