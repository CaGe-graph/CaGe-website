<h3>Internal constants</h3>

In this section internal constants are discussed. The behaviour of CaGe
depends on the values of some internal constants. Usually there is no need to
change the values of these constants. Changing the values is done by editing
the source program <strong>CaGe.c</strong> and then recompiling the source code
(using the command <strong>make</strong> --- see <strong>README</strong> file). 
This means that you
need to have basic knowledge about the programming language <strong>C</strong>. 
The following constants are listed at the top of the source code (called
<strong>public definitions</strong>) or after
the first big comment page (called <strong>internal definitions</strong>):
<dir>
<li><strong>ENDIAN_OUT/ENDIAN_IN:</strong>  The value depends on the machine the 
source code is compiled on. SGI machines are known to be big endian while most
other machines are little endian. If the definition does not fit to your
computer, you do not need to change it if other programs which interact with
CaGe are able to handle both little and big endian. Furthermore, you do
not need to change it if the endian is unimportant 
(see section 
<a href="codes.html"><strong  >codes
</font></strong></a>
).
<li><strong>MAXN:</strong>  If an input graph has more vertices than indicated by this number,
then CaGe will do nonsense. So if you plan to read in bigger graphs, it is
necessary to increase this number.
<li><strong>MAXENTRIES:</strong>  This number indicates the maximum number of code entries
for one input graph, using <strong>planar_code</strong>. For an 
<strong>n</strong>--valent vertex 
<strong>n+1</strong> entries are needed (the numbers of the n adjacent vertices and a zero
at the end). If an input graph requires more entries, then CaGe will do
nonsense. However, this will not occur if a graph with maximal MAXN vertices
or its dual will be read from one of the four generation programs 
<strong>fullgen</strong>, <strong>tubetype</strong>, <strong>HCgen</strong> or <strong>CPF</strong>.
<li><strong>NL:</strong>  This is the string which is assumed to be the newline symbol in
all ASCII--files which are read or written.
