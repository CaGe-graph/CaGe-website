      <h1><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Background 
        Tasks</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CaGe runs 
        two kinds of tasks &quot;in the background&quot;, both are tasks that 
        can take a long time and require no user interaction (other than possibly 
        to cancel them). These tasks are a) generation processes that use <a href="output.html#file_output">file 
        output</a> rather than viewers, and b) the conversion of 3D embeddings 
        to <a href="results.html#folding_nets">folding nets</a>. CaGe shows both 
        of these in an extra &quot;background tasks&quot; window next to the windows 
        CaGe uses for &quot;foreground activities&quot; (defining a new production 
        process and controlling viewer output processes).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some technical 
        information for interested readers (skip this if you are not): Background 
        tasks run within the same Java Virtual Machine as CaGe itself. Java uses 
        <i>threads</i> for concurrent tasks, but these don't actually offer true 
        multitasking; you may notice that the handling of background tasks is 
        temporarily suspended while you engage in foreground activity. However, 
        both kinds of background tasks involve separate <i>processes</i> (for 
        the generators as well as the folding net converter) in which the main 
        work is done, so CaGe can benefit from the operating system's multitasking 
        capabilities. All that CaGe does is read those processes' output, a simple 
        job for which there will often be sufficient time in between your foreground 
        actions.</font></p>

        The background tasks window appears as soon as a background task starts, 
        and it can not be closed as long as some background task is active. This 
        screenshot shows the background tasks window displaying two file output 
        tasks. Each of these has a number (one and two in this example) identifying 
        it during the CaGe session. A finished background task may disappear from 
        the background tasks window, but its number won't be reused within the 
        same CaGe session. There is another field for each file output task which 
        shows the task's progress, in terms of the number of graphs that have 
        been generated and embedded.</font></p>

        Two interactions are possible with a file output task in the background 
        tasks window. The &quot;stop&quot; button cancels the task. If you want 
        to restart a stopped task, you must reschedule it using CaGe's options 
        windows. And the task number is a button as well: if you click it, a dialogue 
        will appear with some information about the background task. This screenshot 
        shows such an information dialogue.</font></p>

        Folding net tasks are also displayed in the background tasks window, in 
        the way shown in the third screenshot. <a href="results.html#folding_nets">Remember</a> 
        that CaGe puts all folding net tasks into a queue. In this example, 8 
        tasks have already passed through the queue, one of these has failed. 
        Two further tasks are still in the queue. You can click the &quot;abort 
        curr(ent)&quot; button if you feel that the first task in the queue is 
        taking too long. The folding net generator can in fact fail after trying 
        a number of ways of &quot;cutting open&quot; a 3D-embedded graph, and 
        you might suspect that this is about to happen with the current folding 
        net task. Tasks that have failed in any way, including those interrupted 
        with the &quot;abort&quot; button, are counted in the &quot;failed&quot; 
        category.</font></p>

        If you try to exit CaGe while a background task of any kind is still active, 
        CaGe will warn you about this and ask what to do with the remaining tasks. 
        The background tasks window will be displayed, along with a message and 
        two extra buttons. The screenshot on the right shows an attempt to exit 
        CaGe at a time when two generation processes with file output have in 
        fact ended (one of them through the &quot;stop&quot; button), but the 
        folding net queue is still active. You can now decide to exit anyway, 
        killing all background tasks, by clicking the &quot;Exit&quot; button. 
        You can also cancel your attempt to exit -- i.e. return to CaGe and continue 
        working -- through the &quot;Cancel&quot; button. If you don't have any 
        further work to do in the CaGe but want to wait for the background tasks 
        to finish, just leave this window alone. As soon as the last background 
        task has finished, CaGe will exit. If you have used any &quot;stop&quot; 
        or &quot;abort&quot; buttons in the background window since the exit warning 
        has appeared, the exit will not be automatic, instead you will have to 
        click once more to decide whether to exit or cancel the exit (return to 
        CaGe).</font></p>
