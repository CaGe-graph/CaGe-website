        Results</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This page 
        explains how you can control processes that use viewer output. The viewers 
        themselves open in separate windows and are documented on separate pages 
        (find links <a href="#viewers">at the bottom</a>). Processes with file 
        output are much simpler and are explained on a <a href="background.html">separate 
        page</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We consider 
        most generated graph sets too large for complete user inspection. You 
        can picture the production process as a sequence of embedded graphs &quot;flowing&quot; 
        past you. You stop this flow at certain points and CaGe will show you 
        the current graph in all the viewers you have requested. Initially, CaGe 
        is set to stop the &quot;flow&quot; at the first graph.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's use 
        the set of C<font size="-2"><sub>60</sub></font> fullerenes -- numbering 
        1812 and introduced on the <a href="fullerenes.html">fullerenes page</a> 
        -- as an example. We assume that you have started CaGe, chosen the fullerenes 
        generator, kept the fullerenes options window in its original state (min 
        = max = 60 C atoms, no other option selected), and clicked &quot;Next&quot;. 
        In the output options window, you have requested 2D and 3D embedding, 
        selected some viewers, and again clicked &quot;Next&quot;.</font></p>

        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CaGe 
        is now showing the window seen on the right, the <b>results window</b>. 
        And CaGe has started the production process and is waiting for a graph 
        to come in. Our fullerenes generator takes a short time for initialization 
        and then writes out the first graph. CaGe reads the graph, sets the top 
        number in the results window (labelled &quot;generated&quot;) to one and 
        hands the graph over to two embedder processes, one each for calculating 
        2D and 3D coordinates. After the embeddings have been returned, CaGe increases 
        the second number (labelled &quot;view/goto&quot;) to one and passes the 
        graph to all selected viewers. Our first screenshot shows the results 
        window at this time.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        The number labelled &quot;view/goto&quot; is the number of the <b>current 
        graph</b>, the graph shown in all viewer windows. It is also shown between 
        the two arrow buttons, labelled &quot;review&quot;, in the bottom third 
        of the results window.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saving the 
        current graph</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four 
        &quot;save&quot; buttons below the &quot;view/goto&quot; number can be 
        used to store the current graph in various ways. The first three, &quot;adj&quot;, 
        &quot;2D&quot;, and &quot;3D&quot;, save the graph as it is, but with 
        different embeddings. The formats available are the same that you can 
        use when selecting <a href="output.html#file_output">file output</a> in 
        the output options window (creating a background task). The idea behind 
        these buttons is that you can save your own collection of &quot;interesting&quot; 
        graphs, taken from some complete result set. Therefore, you are only once 
        asked for a <a href="output.html#destinations">destination</a> and format 
        to use for &quot;adj&quot;, &quot;2D&quot;, and &quot;3D&quot; output. 
        After these have been supplied and confirmed by clicking &quot;Ok&quot; 
        in the save dialogue (not shown), you simply press these buttons once 
        for each graph you wish to save. After a graph has been saved, the respective 
        save button will be disabled so you can't save it again. You can save 
        graphs in an order different from that produced by the generator by using 
        the &quot;review&quot; buttons to go back to a previous, unsaved graph 
        (see below).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You don't 
        always see all save buttons. &quot;adj&quot; is always there, &quot;2D&quot; 
        and &quot;3D&quot; are only shown if you have requested the respective 
        embedding in the output options window. The folding net function (see 
        next paragraph) is only available if 3D embedding has been chosen.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="folding_nets"></a>Saving 
        a folding net for the current graph</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A folding 
        net is a 2D drawing of a graph's 3D embedding. It is produced by taking 
        the 3D-embedded graph as produced by CaGe, cutting it open along a suitably 
        chosen subset of edges, and rotating the faces around some uncut edge 
        so that all faces finally come to rest on a common 2D plane. (Some faces 
        may have to be straightened as well.) The idea is that you can print the 
        resulting drawing on paper, cut it out and fold it back together, building 
        a 3D model of the graph or molecule. Choosing the exact way to cut open 
        and unfold the faces is a complicated process, and this is performed by 
        a separate program that CaGe runs in the background, the <b>folding net 
        converter</b>. If you use the &quot;folding net&quot; button, CaGe adds 
        your request to a queue of folding net tasks. This queue is processed 
        in the background, progress is shown in the background tasks window (<a href="#background_tasks">see 
        below</a>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;folding 
        net&quot; button always asks for a <a href="output.html#destinations">destination</a> 
        to save to, unlike the other save buttons. It never asks for a format, 
        though: the folding net converter writes its output in PostScript.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advancing 
        and reviewing</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have mentioned 
        that CaGe adopts a &quot;flow&quot; model for handling the generated graph 
        sequence. That flow is automatically stopped at the first graph, and it 
        is then up to you to move forward. The controls next to the &quot;advance&quot; 
        label serve this purpose. The &quot;+1&quot; and &quot;+10&quot; buttons 
        shown in our screenshots do just what they imply. &quot;+10&quot; is just 
        a default, though, you can change this button to any fixed distance greater 
        than one by changing the value in the field to the left of the button. 
        We will refer to this button as &quot;+<i>d</i>&quot; instead of &quot;+10&quot; 
        from now on.</font></p>

        Press the &quot;+1&quot; button three times to advance from graph number 
        1 to number 4. At this point, you may want to compare the fourth graph 
        with one of the earlier ones. You can look back at graphs you have previously 
        stopped at using the two arrow buttons next to the &quot;<b>review</b>&quot; 
        label. Our second screenshot shows the results window after advancing 
        to graph 4 as described above, and pressing the backward review button 
        twice to look back at graph 2.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="goto"></a>Besides 
        moving forward by some given distance, you can also set the target number 
        to move to. Just enter that number in the &quot;view/goto&quot; field. 
        This can be the number of a graph previously stopped at, eliminating the 
        need to click the forward or backward review buttons repeatedly. As a 
        special shortcut, 0 (zero) can be entered to move to the last graph in 
        the review list. You can also enter a number larger than the number of 
        currently generated graphs, causing CaGe to advance to that number (as 
        long as the generator will actually produce this many graphs, otherwise 
        CaGe will stop advancing when the sequence ends). And finally, you can 
        redisplay the current graph: click into the &quot;view/goto&quot; field 
        in the <a href="results.html#goto">results window</a>, don't change the 
        number, and press Return.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We say that 
        CaGe is &quot;flowing&quot; whenever it is reading graphs from the generator, 
        e.g. when you are asking CaGe to advance to some graph number either by 
        entering the number in the &quot;view/goto&quot; field or by using the 
        &quot;+1&quot; and &quot;+<i>d</i>&quot; buttons. There is a button in 
        the &quot;advance&quot; section titled &quot;flow&quot;, and CaGe presses 
        and releases this button automatically to reflect its flowing state. While 
        CaGe is flowing, you can't advance: the &quot;+1&quot; and &quot;+<i>d</i>&quot; 
        buttons are disabled, and entering a number in &quot;view/goto&quot; beyond 
        the highest graph number in the review list will not be accepted.</font></p>

        the &quot;flow&quot; button, too. If CaGe is not flowing, press &quot;flow&quot; 
        to move the generation process forward indefinitely. CaGe will read graphs 
        and increase the &quot;generated&quot; number, but never stop by itself 
        unless the generation ends.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whenever 
        CaGe is flowing -- whether you have pressed &quot;flow&quot; or asked 
        CaGe to advance to a particular graph number -- you can release &quot;flow&quot; 
        and CaGe will immediately embed and then display the latest graph it has 
        finished reading from the generator. If no such graph has been produced 
        since the flow was last stopped (or none at all yet), flowing will stop 
        and you can operate the +1, +<i>d</i>, or &quot;flow&quot; buttons to 
        tell CaGe what graph to advance to next, or to start flowing indefinitely.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two screenshots 
        on the right show the results window after &quot;flow&quot; has been pressed 
        and CaGe left flowing for a short while, and then after &quot;flow&quot; 
        has been released a moment later. CaGe stops at the next possible graph 
        number, 936 in this example, adds it to the end of the review list and 
        displays the graph. All intermittent graphs (between 4 and 936) are lost.</font></p>
