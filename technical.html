      <h1>Technical information</h1>
      <p>If you feel 
        inclined to take a deeper look into the CaGe, or possibly extend it, this 
        page is for you.</p>
      <h1>The production process:<br>
        Generators and Embedders</h1>
      <p>CaGe is a 
        &quot;control center&quot; for a collection of programs that do the actual 
        work. These external programs are our generators and embedders.</p>
      <p><a name="pipes"></a>CaGe 
        communicates with these programs using pipes -- the input/output mechanism 
        best known from the UNIX world. The external programs aren't actually 
        &quot;aware&quot; that they are working in the CaGe, they only read and 
        write data using the three standard i/o streams known as standard input, 
        standard output and standard error. CaGe sets these streams up and reads 
        from or writes into them.</p>
      <p><a name="generator"></a>A 
        <b>Generator</b> 
        can be any program that produces graphs on standard output, in any of 
        the formats understood by CaGe. From a technical point of view, a generator 
        is nothing more than such a graphs-producing program controlled via its 
        command line, possibly supported by a Java class to define its own options 
        window within CaGe. If you would like to use a generator program without 
        writing Java code for the options window, you can do so via the <a href="external.html">external 
        generator</a> button in CaGe's <a href="generators.html">first window</a>, 
        providing a command line with all option parameters there.</p>
      <p><a name="embedder"></a>An 
        <b>Embedder</b> takes one graph and computes (2D or 3D) coordinates for 
        its vertices. Like the generators, it must use the graph formats known 
        to CaGe, and it must output the graph's vertices in the same order as 
        they were supplied in the input. CaGe needs some additional information 
        about an embedder: it must have methods to manipulate the embedder command 
        line to make the embedder spend more time trying to achieve a good embedding, 
        and to start a 2D re-embedding with a new exterior face.</p>
      <p>After a generator 
        has been selected and output options chosen, CaGe starts the generation 
        program and reads graphs from it. Graphs selected for output are passed 
        on to the appropriate embedder. (If both 2D and 3D output was chosen, 
        embedder processes are run separately for the two dimensions.)</p>
      <h2>Adding a Generator</h2>
      <p>If you want 
        to use a new generator with its own options window, you need to provide 
        CaGe with a Java class extending <tt><b>cage.GeneratorPanel</b></tt>, 
        a subclass of <tt><b>javax.swing.JPanel</b></tt>. 
        CaGe will instantiate an object of this class, add it to a window, call 
        the method <tt><b>showing</b></tt> 
        to allow some extra preparation and then show the window. After the user 
        has clicked &quot;Next&quot; on another panel in the same window, <tt><b>getGeneratorInfo</b></tt> 
        is called which must return an object of type <tt><b>cage.GeneratorInfo</b></tt>, 
        containing several items of information such as the command line that 
        you would otherwise enter in the &quot;external generator&quot; options 
        window.<br>
        You need to add entries to the configuration file <tt><b>CaGe.ini</b></tt>
        to make CaGe offer the new generator to the user. The existing entries 
        will provide you with a template. To access other entries from the configuration 
        file, you can use the static <tt><b>getConfigProperty</b></tt> 
        method of the <tt><b>cage.CaGe</b></tt> class.</p>
      <p>CaGe has 
        little flexibility as yet with respect to the format a generator is expected 
        to produce, even if a GeneratorPanel is provided. All generators are currently 
        required to output one of CaGe's two input formats described below.</p>
      <h2>Adding an Embedder</h2>
	  <p>Adding your own embedder to CaGe is a fairly uncommon use-case in our eyes.
	  If however you do feel the need to use a specific embedder that is not part of
	  CaGe, then <a href="documentation/embedderguide.pdf">this guide</a> might provide you with the necessary
	  information and tips.</p>


      <h1><a name="formats"></a>Formats</h1>
      <p>There are 
        currently two graph formats that CaGe can read, so generators and embedders 
        must use one of these for their output. CaGe will try to recognize which 
        of these formats it is reading.</p>
      <h2>Format headers</h2>
      <p>CaGe's input 
        formats have an optional header identifying the format in an unambiguous 
        way. If there is no header in an input that CaGe is reading, the program 
        will guess from the first byte, but false guesses are possible. A header 
        consists of the <b>format name</b> enclosed in double angle brackets &gt;&gt;...&lt;&lt;. 
        These brackets can also contain a comment, separated from the format name 
        by white space. The header can be on its own line (i.e. followed by a 
        line separator) if the format is line-oriented (which currently applies 
        to the writegraph format, described next).</p>
      <h2>The Writegraph format (input/output)</h2>
      <p><i>Format names used in headers: writegraph,&nbsp;writegraph2d,&nbsp;writegraph3d</i></p>
      <p>This format 
        originated from Combinatorica, a Mathematica package. It is a plain-text 
        format and easily readable for humans. There is one line for each vertex, 
        and this line contains, separated by white space, &#149;&nbsp;the vertex 
        number (sequentially numbered, starting with one) &#149;&nbsp;vertex coordinates, 
        &#149;&nbsp;the numbers of all vertices adjacent to the current one. Since 
        we deal with lists of graphs, we define a line containing just the number 
        zero as the separator between two graphs (as zero is not a valid vertex 
        number).</p>
      <p>When encoding 
        an embedded graph (with coordinates for the vertices), writegraph is the 
        format of choice. It then contains either the 2D or 3D embedding, and 
        the format name in the header is expected to communicate this fact. For 
        a non-embedded graph, it is possible to include no coordinates (and use 
        &quot;writegraph&quot; without a dimension in the header), but there is 
        also the convention of including zero coordinates (and the format name 
        should then specify the number of zero coordinates used for each vertex 
        as &quot;2d&quot; or &quot;3d&quot;). One comment sometimes given in the 
        header after the format name is &quot;planar&quot;, signifying that the 
        order in which vertices are listed can be used to construct a planar embedding 
        of the graph. See &quot;Planar Code&quot; for details.</p>
      <h2>The Planar Code format (input/output)</h2>
      <p><i>Format names used in headers: planar_code,&nbsp;embed_code</i></p>
      <p>This is a 
        binary format not including coordinate information. Planar code does however 
        contain a hint for a 2D embedding as a convention. This information lies 
        in the order that a vertex's adjacencies are listed.</p>
      <p>A Planar Code representation of a graph starts with a number giving the total number 
        of vertices. Then, for each vertex, follows a sequence of numbers specifiying 
        that vertex's neighbours. This sequence must enumerate the neighbours 
        as they appear when you go clockwise in one circle around the vertex. 
        Going anti-clockwise is allowed as well, but the direction must be the 
        same for all vertices of the graph. This information is actually a partial 
        encoding of a 2D embedding of the graph, and it is used by our 2D embedder.</p>
      <h2><a name="PDB_CML"></a>Other formats (output only): PDB and CML</h2>
      <p>CaGe can save graphs in two other popular formats, <b>PDB</b> and <b>CML</b>. Both 
        of these are popular in the chemistry world and &quot;rich&quot; formats, 
        providing ways of expressing large amounts of different chemical information. 
        By the nature of its production process, CaGe doesn't know much about 
        the chemistry of its results, and thus only uses a small part of the CML 
        and PDB languages. The &gt;&gt;...&lt;&lt; format headers defined above 
        are not used with CML and PDB in order to produce compatible output.<br>
        In PDB, CaGe uses &quot;ATOM&quot; and &quot;CONECT&quot; records to encode 
        vertices and edges of its graphs. The CML features used by CaGe have been 
        chosen to produce CML output that is both compact and readable by one 
        of its viewers, <a href="jmol.html">Jmol</a>, which CaGe &quot;feeds&quot; 
        with graphs to display via this CML format. CML's <tt><b>&lt;molecule&gt;</b></tt> 
        tag is amended by CaGe with a <tt><b>convention=&quot;MathGraph&quot;</b></tt>
        attribute. This instructs our &quot;tailored&quot; version of the Jmol 
        applet to strictly adhere to the atom coordinates and bonds given in the 
        input, rather than try to embed any atoms itself or second-guess the existence 
        or absence of bonds. (By contrast, there is no way to get the Rasmol viewer 
        out of its bond-guessing habit.)</p>
