      <h1>Output Options</h1>
      <p>After choosing 
        a generator and setting all its options, the final step is to tell CaGe 
        which kind(s) of embeddings you want (2D and/or 3D) and whether you want 
        to visually inspect results or run a background task to store the complete 
        result set in a file.</p>

      <p><br>
        In the Output Options window
        many controls are actually inivisible until you make choices that 
        reveal them. All you see initially are the  <b>prefilter checkbox</b>,
	the <b>dimension checkboxes</b> 
        (labelled &quot;3D/2D representation&quot;) and, for both dimensions, 
        the <b>output mode radio buttons</b>, named &quot;Viewer&quot; and &quot;File/Pipe&quot;. 
        We could have hidden these radio buttons as well, but they offer a shortcut: 
        Click either &quot;Viewer&quot; or &quot;File/Pipe&quot; for any dimension, 
        and the respective dimension checkbox will be selected automatically, 
        saving one click.</p>
      <p>The topmost 
        checkbox, &quot;Pre-filter Graphs&quot;, will activate a text input when 
        clicked. You are expected to enter a command here, and this command will 
        be connected to the generator's output using a pipe. 
        The command will therefore be able to read graphs on standard input as 
        they come from the generator (which generally will be non-embedded graphs), 
        and CaGe will expect to read some graphs, in one of the <a href="technical.html#formats">formats</a> 
        supported by CaGe, from the filter command's standard output. (Your command 
        can itself be a &quot;pipeline&quot; -- see <a href="#pipeline">below</a> 
        for more details.)</p>

      <h2><br><a name="viewer_output"></a>Viewer output</h2>
      <p>Our second 
        screenshot shows the Output Options window after the two &quot;Viewer&quot; 
        radio buttons for 2D and 3D have been clicked. Just below each of these 
        radio buttons, a row of <b>viewer checkboxes</b> has appeared. Select 
        any number of these checkboxes to choose one or more viewers for each 
        dimension. CaGe will not let you deselect all viewer checkboxes, you have 
        to uncheck the respective dimension checkbox instead. If one viewer is 
        selected and you want to switch to another, you would have to select that 
        other viewer first and then deselect the current one, an unintuitive clicking 
        sequence for many users. But there is a shortcut: You can <i>shift-click</i> 
        a viewer to select it &quot;exclusively&quot;, deselecting all other viewers.</p>
      <p>The &quot;text 
        viewer&quot; shows all coordinates (2D and 3D) that you have chosen to 
        produce, in one window. Therefore, the &quot;text viewer&quot; checkboxes 
        shown in the 3D and 2D areas refer to the same viewer window. Deselecting 
        the &quot;text viewer&quot; checkbox in one dimension will also deselect 
        it in the other. If the text viewer has been the only selected viewer 
        in that other dimension (it won't be in the dimension where CaGe has let 
        you deselect it), CaGe will deselect that other dimension altogether.</p>

      <h2><br><a name="file_output"></a>File output</h2>
      <p>In the third 
        screenshot you see all the controls that appear, in place of the viewer 
        checkboxes, if you select the &quot;File/Pipe&quot; checkboxes and/or 
        the &quot;Adjacency information&quot; checkbox (which you might call the 
        zero dimension checkbox -- there is no zero-D viewer and therefore no 
        choice of viewer vs. file output for &quot;adjacency&quot;). Whereever 
        you choose file or pipe output, you are asked for the <a href="#destinations">destination</a> 
        and the format to use. For each generated graph, CaGe will create any 
        requested embeddings and write the embedded graph to the given destinations 
        in the selected formats. In the screenshot, the format box for 3D has 
        been clicked on to reveal the available 3D formats. CaGe actually uses 
        just a small <a href="technical.html#PDB_CML">subset</a> of both the PDB 
        and CML languages.</p>
      <h2><a name="destinations"></a>Where your data is saved</h2>
      <p>You supply 
        all save destinations via a text field. Normally this will be interpreted 
        as a filename, relative to the directory in which the generation process 
        is run (see <b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CaGe.Generators.RunDir</font></b> 
        in the configuration file <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CaGe.ini</font>). 
        If you start the destination with the '|' character, it will be interpreted 
        as a pipeline. CaGe will start this pipeline and write to its standard 
        input.</p>
      <p><a name="pipeline"></a>A 
        <b>pipeline</b> is a sequence of commands, separated by '|' characters, 
        with each command's standard output connected to the next command's standard 
        input --, but no other shell interpretation will be performed unless you 
        call the shell as part of the command. All pipelines are also run in the 
        directory given by <b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CaGe.Generators.RunDir</font></b> 
        in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CaGe.ini</font>.</p>
      <h2>Either viewer output or file output</h2>
      <p>You can not 
        select file output for some dimensions and viewer output for some others. 
        CaGe will disable the &quot;Next&quot; button if you try. Remember that 
        the &quot;zero&quot; dimension, adjacency information, only allows file 
        output.</p>
