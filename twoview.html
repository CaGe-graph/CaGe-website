      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 2D viewer 
        can show vertex numbers and has a &quot;re-embedding&quot; feature that 
        effectively turns the 2D plane (upon which our graphs are embedded) into 
        a closed surface (such as the surface of a sphere). TwoView is configured 
        through the controls near the top of the window, with initial values coming 
        from the configuration file <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CaGe.ini</font>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        This screenshot shows TwoView displaying the same graph we have seen in 
        Jmol on the <a href="jmol.html">previous page</a>. TwoView offers buttons 
        to select the size of the vertex symbols, a checkbox to decide whether 
        vertex numbers should be shown, and a slider and a number field to control 
        the appearance of the edges. Showing vertex numbers may increase the size 
        of the vertex symbols, and using smaller vertex symbols may turn off the 
        display of vertex numbers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Re-embedding 
        takes place when you click the mouse somewhere within an interior face 
        of the graph. The 2D embedder is then called to compute a new 2D embedding 
        in which the clicked face becomes the &quot;outside&quot; face. (There 
        is a command line option that communicates the face clicked into to the 
        embedder. CaGe calls the embedder with that option and writes the current 
        state of the graph to the embedder's input. Some generators disable the 
        re-embedding feature; in that case, TwoView won't react to mouse clicks 
        within graph faces and the &quot;reset embedding&quot; button shown in 
        these screenshots will be absent from the TwoView window.)</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        The second screenshot shows TwoView after clicking the mouse within the 
        face surrounded by vertices 56, 57, 58, 59, and 60, and adjusting the 
        controls to use smaller vertex symbols without numbers. Without these 
        adjustments it would have been difficult to see the edges around the smaller 
        faces in the display.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How can an 
        interior face suddenly become the exterior one? Imagine you have drawn 
        the original 2D graph onto the front half of some super-elastic balloon. 
        Now punch a circular hole into the balloon surface, within one of the 
        faces. Our balloon is elastic and not tightly filled up, so it won't explode. 
        Imagine the immediate surroundings of the hole being like a ring-shaped 
        rubber band. Take that ring into both hands, your fingers reaching through 
        the hole into the inside of the balloon, and pull out the ring, expanding 
        it into a large circle. The rest of the balloon material is of course 
        still attached to the rubber ring and is pulled into a straight planar 
        shape as the ring becomes very large. On the balloon material you will 
        now find a 2D drawing of our graph with a new outside face. It will need 
        some vertex repositioning, but it provides a start. The embedder does 
        not actually work in this way, but using this model we hope to explain 
        why there is nothing special about the outside face, and why we said in 
        the beginning that we are considering our 2D plane a closed, spherical 
        surface rather than a standard (Euclidean) plane.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you 
        have re-embedded a graph in this way, the button titled &quot;reset embedding&quot; 
        is enabled. Clicking it will reset the 2D embedding to its original state. 
        If you don't use this button, the 2D embedding will be kept in its changed 
        state, even if you move on to other graphs and later use the results window's 
        &quot;<a href="results.html#reviewing">review</a>&quot; buttons to return 
        to this one. This also affects the &quot;2D&quot; save button in the results 
        window: it will save the 2D embedding that TwoView is showing, and if 
        you do change the 2D embedding via TwoView you can actually 2D-save again 
        (the 2D button in the results window will be enabled even if you have 
        used it before).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TwoView itself 
        has a save button as well: &quot;save PS&quot; button will write a PostScript 
        representation of the graph as currently shown by TwoView, with all effects 
        of TwoView's various control settings reproduced as closely as possible. 
        A short dialogue asks you for the <a href="output.html#destinations">destination</a> 
        and whether you want to include some headline for the graph.</font></p>
